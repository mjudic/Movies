# Traace Front Exercise

## Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## API url
```bash
http://localhost:5173/api (/api)
```

## Specs

The goal of the app that you’re building is to list movies ranked by rating and be able to filter them by genres using **React**.

At this moment, the app is basically a blank page with a title. Feel free to delete the title if you want.

You’re in charge of the front end and the server you're using is in the repo in the server.js file.

What we expect you to build, is an interface for displaying the **Best movies ranked by scores**

The table should have the following columns:
- Poster
- Rating
- Title
- Year of release
- Duration (with the format hh:mm)
- Plot
- Genre *Clickable to filter the list*

Feel free to group multiple information in one column if you think it’s relevant!
An advanced requirement is to make the table paginated (the server handles pagination, read the code to understand how it works).

## Side notes

- You **must** use **react** and **functional components**. The interface **must** be in english. For the rest, we use Typescript and Antd as a component library, but feel free to use any library you’re comfortable with. Just make sure the code is easy to understand for us :)
- It's OK if you don't deliver everything that is asked for. Deliver a working interface and we can discuss how to improve it during the interview.
- It’s important that you produce clear, reusable, future-proof code.
- Produce a good-looking interface, but don’t focus on fancy CSS the quality of the JS is more important.
- Don’t hesitate to comment your code if you feel it will make it clearer
- Take the time you need, but more importantly take the time you have available to do this exercise. Set yourself a time limit and try to stick to it. It's fine if you don't manage to do everything. Just tell us in your email how long it took you and we will take this into account in our rating.

## Deliverable

You’re expected to deliver a Github Repo with clear install and run instructions as well as a screenshot in the readme file.
